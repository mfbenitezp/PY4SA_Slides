## Failure

-   You will fail, but that is ok, it is part of the process.
-   Don't be afraid of it.
-   Error messages are scary, I know, but they are useful as well

# Why Python

-   A free and open-sourced scripting language that was commonly used to automate tasks (GIS world).
-   Nowadays can be used to read, process and map spatial data. It uses a code structure, referred to as syntax, that is easy to read and understand.
-   Syntax helps beginners to learn the language and helps professionals to minimise development and maintenance costs.
-   Python has thousands of packages so that you can integrate a vast number of tools and programs.

## What makes a Python script?

:::{style="margin-bottom: 2em;"}
A Python script is a sequence of instructions. The structure and arrangement of the instructions are referred to as syntax. Python instructions use various language elements, including data types, statements, and functions.
:::

![](img/Picture6.png){width="874"}

## Why is it so powerful

-   Modules are collections of related code that contain variables, definitions, and instructions.
    -   These modules are organised into packages, which can be further grouped into libraries.
-   These libraries are typically specialised and enable you to perform higher-level tasks related to those specialities.
    -   For example, `Pandas` enables you to work with tabular data, `NumPy` grant the ability to make advanced mathematical and scientific computations, and `Matplotlib` allows you to visualise data graphically.

## Python Modes

There are many ways to write and run a python script:

-   Your terminal (Mac, Win, Linux)
-   Python scripts (.py) (Programs)
-   Ipython - Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb): Interactive, widely use in research
-   Google Colab (Cloud service, require a google account)
-   More...

# Conda - Miniconda {.smaller}

-   `Conda` is an open-source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-   Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs but can package and distribute software for any language.
-   `Miniconda` is a minimal installer for conda. It is a small version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.

# GIT -- Version control {.smaller}

Git is open-source software for version control, which means that it tracks changes to your files as you work on them over time.

Similar to "track changes" feature in a word document, except you must choose which versions to include in the tracking---it is not automatic.

It can be tricky, and we may or may not have issues; it happens to everyone. Widely used in academia and industry.

# Github? {.smaller}

GitHub is a web-based version control system which uses Git, the open-source version control software. It provides a place for developers to host and share their projects --- a space to save earlier iterations and collaborate with other developers, colleagues, or co-workers.

It can be used even to host websites, research projects, portfolios, data, and more.

It is widely popular and can be a way to get a job nowadays in the GIScience field.

## Terminology {.smaller .scrollable}

-   **Repository:** Is a project (a folder) containing files and sub-folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders.
-   **Branch:** A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named main and is considered the definitive branch. You can use branches to have different project versions at once.
-   **Clone:** Local copy of a repository stored on the cloud. Clones can be synced up with their originals in the GitHub repository.
-   **Commit:** A commit is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch.
-   **Fork:** "Forking" is when you copy another user's repository to your account. You can make any changes to your forked copy, leaving the original unaffected. 
-   **Pull/push:** Merging changes made to the repository files into the local copy you're working on is called "pulling." A "push" is the reverse --- updating the repository files with changes you've made to your local copy.
-   **Pull request:** Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people. This pull request will keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the main branch.
-   **Merge:** A merge adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the main branch

## As simple as a calculator

Let us calculate the distance between `U St Andrews` and `Edinburgh`, but in `kms`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

53.2 * 1.609344
```

## Variables

-   Great calculator, but how can we make it store values?
-   Do this by defining variables
-   Can later be called by the variable name
-   Variable names are case-sensitive and unique

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

DistanceStAndrewsToEDI = 53.2
MilesToKm = 1.609344
DistanceFromStAndrewsToEDI = DistanceStAndrewsToEDI * MilesToKm
DistanceFromStAndrewsToEDI

```

## Variables

We can now reuse the variable `MileToKms` in the next cell without having to define it again!

![](img/variables_python.png){width="50%" fig-align="center"}
:::

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

MarathonDistanceInMiles = 26.219
MarathonDistanceInKms = MilesToKm * MarathonDistanceInMiles
MarathonDistanceInKms
```

## Types of variable

::: {style="margin-bottom: 0.9em;"}
Variables actually `have a type`, which defines the way it is stored. The basic types are:
:::

::: {layout-nrow="1" style="margin-bottom: 0.3em; max-width: 90%"}
![](img/types_variable.png)
:::

## Why this is important {.smaller}

::: {layout-nrow="1" style="margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;"}
![](img/error_variable.png)
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="minimal"}
**To remember!** We can't do arithmetic operations on variables of different types. Therefore, make sure that you are always aware of your variables types! You can find the type of a variable by adding `type()`. For example: `type(x)`.
:::

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
x = 10
type(x)
```

## Casting types

**Luckily**, Python offers us a way of converting variables to different types!

*Casting* -- the operation of converting a variable to a different type

```{python}

#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

y = '20'
a = x + int(y)
print(a)

```

Similar methods exist for other data types: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`

# Quiz

What would be the result?

```{python}

#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
x = '10'
y = '20'
x+y
```

## List

- Allow to store multiple numbers, strings, or booleans in a single variable.
- Square brackets are used to denote lists. Items in a **list** are ordered, indexed, and allow for duplicate members. 
- Indexing starts at 0.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
lst1 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 2, 0]
lst2 = ["A", "B", "C"]
lst3 = [True, False, True]
print(lst1[0])
print(lst1[0:3])
print(lst2[-4:-1])
```

## Dictionaries {auto-animate="true"}

Are unordered, changeable, indexed, and do not allow duplicate elements. In contrast to lists each **value** is also assigned with **key**.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
Values can be selected using the **associated key**. You can also use the key to define a value to change.
:::

```{.python code-line-numbers="|1|4"}
cls = {"code": "GG3209", "Name":"Spatial Analysis with Python"}
print(cls)
print(cls["Name"])
cls["code"] = 461
print(cls)
```

## Dictionaries {auto-animate="true"}

Are unordered, changeable, indexed, and do not allow duplicate elements. In contrast to lists each **value** is also assigned with **key**.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="default"}
Values can be selected using the **associated key**. You can also use the key to define a value to change.
:::

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
cls = {"code": "GG3209", "Name":"Spatial Analysis with Python"}
print(cls)
print(cls["Name"])
cls["code"] = 461
print(cls)
```

## Arrays
Similar to **lists**; however, they must be `declared`. In this course, we will primarily work with **NumPy** arrays, which will be discussed in more detail in a later module.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_array)

print(my_array[0])   # Output: 1
print(my_array[2])   # Output: 3
my_array[1] = 7

print(my_array)

```

## Commenting

- Useful when you want to remove the code from execution but not permanently
- *Useful* when your code needs further explanation. Whether for you or anybody else.
- Comments in Python are done with `#`

```{.python code-line-numbers="|1|-|5-8|"}
### You can comment before the lines
a=3 # You can comment next to the line
b=5
# After the lines
'''
This is a multiline
comment.
'''
```

# Lab No 1
