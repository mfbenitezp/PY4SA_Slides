## Housekeeping
- Lecture with basic concepts and some demonstrations
- Labs with exercises, Assessment No 2
- Course Resources:
- Course Book (Labs, assessment, Slides)
- If something is not clear, stop me and ask.
- During exercises (you can also ask for assistance from the TAs).
  
## Module in a glance 

- What is Python, and why will you use it
- Building blocks – What components will we use
  - Miniconda
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Git – GitHub Account
- Python Basics
  - Two notebooks for guidance 
  - One notebook for practice


## Let me ask you something

- Do you have any programming experience?
  - Why should we learn to program?
- Why should we learn Python if we can use QGIS or another GIS tool?

## Failure

- You will fail, but that is ok, it is part of the process.
- Don't be afraid of it.
- Error messages are scary, I know, but they are useful as well

# Why Python
::: {.r-fit-text}
- A free and open-sourced scripting language that was commonly used to automate tasks (GIS world). 
- Nowadays can be used to read, process and map spatial data. It uses a code structure, referred to as syntax, that is easy to read and understand. 
- Syntax helps beginners to learn the language and helps professionals to minimise development and maintenance costs. 
- Python has thousands of packages so that you can integrate a vast number of tools and programs.

## What makes a Python script?

A Python script is a sequence of instructions. The structure and arrangement of the instructions are referred to as syntax. Python instructions use various language elements, including data types, statements, and functions.

![](img/Picture6.png)

## Why is it so powerful

- Modules are collections of related code that contain variables, definitions, and instructions. 
  - These modules are organised into packages, which can be further grouped into libraries. 
- These libraries are typically specialised and enable you to perform higher-level tasks related to those specialities. 
  - For example, **Pandas** enables you to work with tabular data, **NumPy** grant the ability to make advanced mathematical and scientific computations, and **Matplotlib** allows you to visualise data graphically.



## Python Modes

There are many ways to write and run a python script:

- Your terminal (Mac, Win, Linux)
- Python scripts (.py) (Programs)
- Ipython - Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb): Interactive, widely use in research
- Google Colab (Cloud service, require a google account)
- More…


# Demo No 1:

Running a python Script

```{python}
#| echo: true
a = 5
b = 4
c = a+b

print ("The outcomes would be like:")
print (c)
print ("Hello world")

```

# Conda - Miniconda {.smaller}

- Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs but can package and distribute software for any language.
- Miniconda is a minimal installer for conda. It is a small version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.


# Jupyter Notebook (Lab) {.smaller}

# Markdown {.smaller}

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

# GIT – Version control {.smaller}

Git is open-source software for version control, which means that it tracks changes to your files as you work on them over time.

Similar to “track changes” feature in a word document, except you must choose which versions to include in the tracking—it is not automatic.

It can be tricky, and we may or may not have issues; it happens to everyone.
Widely used in academia and industry.

# Github? {.smaller}

GitHub is a web-based version control system which uses Git, the open-source version control software. It provides a place for developers to host and share their projects — a space to save earlier iterations and collaborate with other developers, colleagues, or co-workers.

It can be used even to host websites, research projects, portfolios, data, and more.

It is widely popular and can be a way to get a job nowadays in the GIScience field.

## Terminology {.smaller}

- **Repository:** Is a project (a folder) containing files and sub-folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders.
- **Branch:**  A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named main and is considered the definitive branch. You can use branches to have different project versions at once.
- **Clone:** Local copy of a repository stored on the cloud. Clones can be synced up with their originals in the GitHub repository.
- **Commit:** A commit is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch.
- **Fork:** “Forking” is when you copy another user’s repository to your account. You can make any changes to your forked copy, leaving the original unaffected. 

## Terminology-II {.smaller}
- **Pull/push:** Merging changes made to the repository files into the local copy you’re working on is called “pulling.” A “push” is the reverse — updating the repository files with changes you’ve made to your local copy.
- **Pull request:** Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people. This pull request will keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the main branch.
- **Merge:** A merge adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the main branch
